A Password Generator made in C#.

i made this because i was bored so dont expect updates too often lol

basically Download the source code, unzip it. then run `build - Release` bat file then if it succeeds (As it should after installation), go to `bin\Release\net7.0` then run `PasswordGenerator.exe` file and thats it!
